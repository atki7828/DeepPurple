Opening the Source Code to Galactic Gladiators
--------------------------------------------------------

*  First start by opening your preferred web broswer.

*  Navigate to the github website where Galactic Gladiators is stored.  Which the URL 
is:    

https://github.com/atki7828/DeepPurple

*  On this webpage you should see towards the right side, a green button labeled 
"Clone or download".  Left click on this button and a new pop up will be displayed.
On this new pop up left click on "Download ZIP"


*  Save this ZIP file into an appropriate folder for the game to be stored.

*  Once downloaded, right click on the ZIP file and there will be an option to let
you extract the games contents into the same folder the ZIP file is placed in.

	*  Another option is to open the ZIP file, select all the files, and drag
	all the files into the appropriate folder for the game to be stored.

*  After the files have been extracted, open your version of Unity.

	*  Galactic Gladiators was made in Version 2017.4.21f1 of Unity so we cannot
	ensure that it will run properly on any other version of Unity.

*  Once Unity has been opened, in the top right corner of unity there will be an icon
labeled "open".  Left click on this.

*  Once clicked you must navigate to the folder in which you extracted the games files
into.  After the folder is selected, click on the okay button on the bottom right of 
that pop-up window.

*  From here it may ask you what Unity version you want to use to open this game.
Select Version 2017.4.21f1 of Unity.  Again we cannot ensure that it will run properly 
on any other version of Unity.

*  Now the game should be opened, and you can explore the source code for Galactic 
Gladiators!




(Downloading Through the Command Prompt)

*  To download Galactic Gladiators through your command prompt you must first navigate
to the folder in which you want the game to be downloaded into.

*  Once here, you will need to type in the following command into the command prompt
in order to download Galactic Gladiators correctly.

git clone https://github.com/atki7828/DeepPurple

*  Next you must install git-lfs as our game is using a large file system for 3d models.

*  The command is:
	apt-get install git-lfs
	
*  Once this has finished navigate to where you pulled the game from git, and from here type
the commands:
	git lfs install
	git lfs pull

*  Now all of the files should be pulled correctly.

*  After the download has finished, open up your version of Unity.

*  Once Unity has been opened, in the top right corner of unity there will be an icon
labeled "open".  Left click on this.

*  Once clicked you must navigate to the folder in which you extracted the games files
into.  After the folder is selected, click on the okay button on the bottom right of 
that pop-up window.

*  From here it may ask you what Unity version you want to use to open this game.
Select Version 2017.4.21f1 of Unity.  Again we cannot ensure that it will run properly 
on any other version of Unity.

*  Now the game should be opened, and you can explore the source code for Galactic 
Gladiators!

When pulling try this " apt-get install git-lfs; then in the directory, do 'git lfs install' then 'git lfs pull' "
