git workflow
We will be using branches for working, then pushing stable changes upstream via pull requests.
The Master branch will be for stable/tested versions of the game; do not work on master directly.
Bleeding is our development branch.  Only push changes to bleeding after communicating your changes with the rest of the team.
Create a new branch whenever you are working on some feature.

To create and switch to a new branch:
$ git checkout -b (newBranchName)

When you want to submit the changes and updates you have made, use the following commands:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "message about the changes you've made"
$ git push -u origin (branchName)

To move your change upstream (branch > bleeding > Master), head to https://github.com/atki7828/DeepPurple, select the branch you're working on, and click the New Pull Request button.
Under 'base' select the branch you wish to merge into (most likely Bleeding), and under 'compare' select the branch you're working on.
Write a short message detailing the changes you have made, and click Create pull request.
After confirming all changes with the group, we will decide whether to merge.
